# Time-Series-Analysis-on-Groceries-Data

Problem Statement:

The main objective of the project is to understand the implementation of the time series model and apply it in an appropriate context. The dataset that we have chosen contains details of purchase of a variety of grocery items over time & we aim to utilize this dataset to predict the demand for these different products in future. This will help manage inventory and increase efficiency for the distributors.
